## 🧠 Overview  
**Day 10** of my #100Days100Projects challenge — diving into **Python File Handling**.  
I explored how to **read, write, and manage files** effectively, which is a key part of building real-world applications.  

To apply these skills, I built a **Note Tracking App** 🗒️ that allows users to **create, read, and organize notes**, all stored in simple text files.

## 🎯 Today’s Project Spotlight: Note Tracking App 📝  

A simple yet powerful **note management system** that lets you:  
- ✍️ **Add notes** (saved to file)  
- 📖 **Read notes** (display stored notes)  
- 🗂️ Keep track of ideas or reminders directly in the terminal  

💡 Demonstrates the real-world importance of **file handling** in storing persistent data.
